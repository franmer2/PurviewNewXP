Here is a series of videos to introduce the new Microsoft Purview Data Catalog solution.

This series has been made with the aim of helping you get started as quickly as possible with our data governance solution.

Interestingly, the solution now separates the technical part from the business part, making it possible to set up governance areas without even waiting for the first technical scans to be made. This accelerates the deployment of Microsoft Purview Data Catalog creating domains and governances as well as defining other aspects of governance such as glossary terms or OKRs (Objectives and key results). So, it's possible to start with video 200 and part of video 201 if you want to focus on the business side of data governance.
